# BloggingPersonalAPI

This project was developed for ["roadmap"](https://roadmap.sh/projects/blogging-platform-api).

The "Create", "Read", "Update" and "Delete" operations work simply.

I didn't need to use "AutoMapper" as these are basic operations.

I did not create separate "DTOs" because I thought a single "DTO" would be sufficient.
